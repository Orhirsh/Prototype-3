Welcome to the README file for the **Endless Runner 3D Game** developed in Unity using C# scripting. This game features a character running endlessly through a dynamic 3D environment, where the player must control the character to avoid obstacles and gather points. The character can perform single jumps and double jumps to overcome obstacles, including falling rocks from the sky.

## Gameplay

In this game, you take control of a character who is constantly running forward. Your goal is to avoid obstacles and gather as many points as possible before your inevitable downfall. Obstacles come in various forms, including barriers, crates, and falling rocks.

The game becomes progressively challenging as the character's speed increases over time. One of the key features is the ability to perform jumps to avoid obstacles and navigate through the environment.

## Controls

- **Spacebar**: Pressing spacebar once will make the character perform a single jump to clear small obstacles.
- **Spacebar (Mid-Air)**: If the character is already in the air, pressing the spacebar again will trigger a double jump, allowing you to jump higher and cover larger distances.
- **Right Arrow**: Press the right arrow key to boost the character to extreme speed temporarily.

## Features

- Endless Runner: The game offers an endless and dynamically generated 3D environment.
- Obstacle Avoidance: Use the jump mechanics to avoid obstacles such as barriers, crates, and falling rocks.
- Single and Double Jumps: Perform single jumps and double jumps to navigate through the environment and clear obstacles.
